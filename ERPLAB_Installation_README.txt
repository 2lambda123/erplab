Read me for Downloading/Installing EEGLAB and ERPLAB

First Download EEGLAB online via the following link:
http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/install.html

Make sure you install the latest version on their FTP server.
On July 9th, 2010, their latest version was 8.0.3.5b

Then, download ERPLAB for the latest beta version via the site
http://www.erpinfo.org/

As of right now, the beta version is still being updated. If you would
like a copy of the ERPLAB toolbox, please give Javier Lopez an e-mail
at javlopez@ucdavis.edu.

Please indicate who you are and any additional information so that
Javier can respond to you in a timely fashion.
