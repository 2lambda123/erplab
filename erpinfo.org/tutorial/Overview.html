<p class="paragraph">This tutorial takes you step by step through the analysis of a set of ERP data from a subset of the subjects in an actual published experiment (Luck et al., 2009, <em>Psychophysiology</em>, <em>46</em>: 776-786).  It focuses on giving you experience with the specific steps involved in analyzing a simple prototypical ERP experiment.  For details of the functions used here, see the <a href="http://erpinfo.org/erplab/erplab-documentation/erplab-manual">ERPLAB Toolbox User's Manual</a>.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This tutorial emphasizes using the GUI to process data.  However, much of ERPLAB's power comes from the ability to write Matlab scripts.  Each section therefore contains a box labeled <strong>Equivalent Script Command</strong> that shows how to achieve the same result with a line of script. More details about scripting can be found in the <a href="../scripting/index.html">ERPLAB Scripting Guide</a>. </p>
<p class="paragraph">Note that script commands can also be run from the Matlab command line, which can be very useful.  However, if you try to mix command line actions with GUI actions, you may run into trouble, because the GUI will not &quot;know&quot; about what you did on the command line.  See the ERPLAB Scripting Guide for details.</p>
